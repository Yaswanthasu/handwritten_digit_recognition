# handwritten_digit_recognition
A Deep Learning project for handwritten digit recognition using CNNs, trained on MNIST with support for custom image predictions.

üñäÔ∏è Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning (CNN)

This project demonstrates a Deep Learning model (Convolutional Neural Network ‚Äì CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras to recognize handwritten digits. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset (60,000 training and 10,000 testing samples of digits 0‚Äì9) and achieves high accuracy in digit classification.

The project also supports testing with custom handwritten images, where images are preprocessed and passed through the trained model for prediction.
